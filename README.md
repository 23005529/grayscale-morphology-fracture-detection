# ðŸ¦´ Bone Fracture Detection using Grayscale Morphology (OpenCV)

This project demonstrates a **basic-level implementation** of real-time bone fracture detection using classical image processing techniques like **grayscale morphological operations** and **edge detection** with OpenCV.

It is designed as a simple prototype to process X-ray images, detect possible bone fractures, and visualize the results using bounding boxes.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Read and preprocess grayscale X-ray images
- Enhance contrast using histogram equalization
- Detect fracture-like patterns using:
  - Morphological gradient
  - Canny edge detection
  - Contour analysis
- Visual output with suspected fracture regions highlighted

---

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
